# A Technical Introduction

This space will be used as an introduction to my technical skills. The projects I am able to share will appear here.

<h1>Yummgy - a recipe sharing site</h1>
<h2>Full Stack Web Application hosted on AWS</h2>
<h2>Developed using Java, JavaScript, MySQL, React and Bootstrap</h2>

  I served as Scrum Leader for this project and primary database designer.  I also created the wireframes for the responsive design and contributed to React development.  I was the sole party responsible for deploying the finished application in the AWS ecosystem.

<h1>JDBC DAO TV tracker</h1>
<h2>Team Project using Agile Methodology(JUMP program)</h2>
<p>This is a CLI-based application which allows the user to track what TV shows they are currently watching, plan to watch, or have finished watching.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Utilized JDBC in conjunction with a MySQL database.</li>
  <li>Used Jira to help the team track work tasks.</li>
  <li>Served as Scrum Leader, developed user stories, implemented the Menu class and the SQL Script.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Final Project with Lighting and Texture</h1>
<p>This was a school project where we were allowed to choose a picture to recreate using OpenGL.  This project helped underscore the importance of understanding geometry.
The most technically challenging aspect of this project was managing dependencies.  <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL">This tutorial</a> was crucial
to my success with this project.  The textures used are all my own.</p>

This is the original tableau:

<p>As you can see, I did make some changes to the version in the OpenGL project.  I took the original picture before I had started learning OpenGL and did not understand how
some of the shape complexities were beyond the scope of the assignment and the abilities I could acquire over the course of eight weeks.</p>

Lessons Learned:
<ul>
<li>Separation of concerns should be a consideration from the first line of code written.</li>
<li>When taking pictures for textures, minimize edge shadows.</li>
<li>Take the time to test the drawing of every simple shape in your final tableau independently.</li>
</ul>
