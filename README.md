##Final Project with Lighting and Texture
<p>This was a school project where we were allowed to choose a picture to recreate using OpenGL.  This project helped underscore the importance of understanding geometry.
The most technically challenging aspect of this project was managing dependencies.  <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL">This tutorial</a> was crucial
to my success with this project.  The textures used are all my own.</p>

This is the original tableau:

<p>As you can see, I did make some changes to the version in the OpenGL project.  I took the original picture before I had started learning OpenGL and did not understand how
some of the shape complexities were beyond the scope of the assignment and the abilities I could acquire over the course of eight weeks.</p>

Lessons Learned:
<ul>
<li>Separation of concerns should be a consideration from the first line of code written.</li>
<li>When taking pictures for textures, minimize edge shadows.</li>
<li>Take the time to test the drawing of every simple shape in your final tableau independently.</li>
</ul>
